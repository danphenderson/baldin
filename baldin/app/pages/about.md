# About

As a Cloud Data Platform Engineer with 1.5 years of experience, I am passionate about leading big-data solutions and driving analytics and insights for growth-oriented organizations prioritizing developer experience using CI/CD automation and cloud infrastructure defined as code.

In my previous role, I built and optimized high-performance data engines, increasing Lucerna Health's ingestion pipeline throughput by over 50% and generating significant savings for our customers' compute-expense. I have also co-authored a publication exploring a novel scheme incorporating curvature information generated using SIMD-parallel forward-mode Automatic Differentiation into unconstrained Quasi-Newton minimization of a smooth objective function.

Skilled in AWS, Python, Julia, Spark, DBT, Torch, FastAPI/Django, gRPC, Docker, and ML/NLP, I offer cross-disciplinary expertise in mathematics, computer science, finance, and economics. I seek opportunities to leverage my skills and experience to drive organizational growth and innovation, focusing on backend web application roles in data pipelines, ML/AI, and DevOps/Automation engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy being inspired by the mountains, skiing, biking, and climbing the granite slopes.
